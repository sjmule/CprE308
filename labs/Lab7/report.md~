The prototypes are not identical because C does not support overloading
and if the prototype were the same the system would have issues determining
which command to execute.  The extra parameter is used to indicate where
to start reading the file from.

Files can support open, read, write, lock, poll, and iterate.

When the file is opened it prints "I already told you %d times Hello World!\n", counter++
The counter keeps track of the number of times the file was opened.
When writen to the file prints that this operation is not supported.
When read from the file prints the next few bytes of the message. It returns 0 if at the end of the message. Otherwise it returns the number of bytes read.
When closed, the file prints info about the module.

My kernel is tainted by this, cool, I don't really know what that means,
but I find it interesting.
