In this lab we learned about bash commands and how shell scripts work and are executed.

The hello_world.sh script prints "Hello World" when run

cd is a shell builtin
ls is /bin/ls

The environment variables were exploited since they could be changed by an attacker
to be something different and allowed them access to different files in the operating
system when the OS ran them thinking they were unchanged.
