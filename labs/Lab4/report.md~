One of the expected outputs would be "I am thread 1\n"
The actual output is either "I am thread 0\n" or "I am thread 0\n" "I am thread 2\n" "I am thread 2\n"

After joining the threads, the program outputs
"I am thread 1\n" "I am thread 2\n" "I am thread 0\n"
This is the expected output of the program
